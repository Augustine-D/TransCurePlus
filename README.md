Run the provided Jupyter Notebook to implement the self-training loop for health-related misinformation detection.

The notebook demonstrates the following steps:

Loading and preprocessing labeled data from different health-related domains (alzheimers, cancer, diabetes, depression).
Combining and shuffling the data to create a combined dataset.
Splitting the combined dataset into training and test sets.
Initializing the T5 tokenizer and model for self-training.
Implementing the self-training loop to iteratively improve the model's performance by adding pseudo-labeled instances.
Once the self-training loop is complete, the notebook calculates and displays the precision, recall, and F1 score metrics on the combined dataset, including both labeled and pseudo-labeled data.

Customization
Adjust the number of self-training iterations (num_iterations) as needed.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for tokenization, model training, and evaluation to optimize the results.
